# CABO_SpectraCommAsmbly
*Examing scale dependence of community assembly processes using imaging spectroscopy data in Qu√©bec's northern temperate forest.*

This repository is meant to support the manuscript: 
"Testing the scale dependence of community assembly processes using imaging spectroscopy" by Crofts et al. in prep. 

This study is apart of the larger Canadian Airborne Biodiversity Observatory (http://caboscience.org/) initiative.

# Components
The repository contains an R script composed of nin sections:
01. Define plots 
02. Define minimum number of spectral points (Define_min_spec_points)
03. Extract imaging spectroscopy data (Extract_HSI)
04. Calculate spectral composition (Calc_spec_comp)
05. Extract environmental predictors (Extract_envr)
06. Fit RDA models (RDA_models)
07. Fit MRM models (MRM_models)
08. Examine variance in composition and environment across scales (Data_variance_across_scales)
09. Examine importance of environmental predictors (Envr_importance)

# How to use
This repository is meant to be a reasonably well-documented record of the analyses carried out in the manuscript detailed above. 

# Associated data products
At the time of publication, data will be made publically available via Dryad repository.
